# AuRo_Final SP2023

Utilizing two Kinova Gen3-lite robotic arms, the final project aims to showcase topics learned in the course by passing an object between them using points generated by the Intel Real-Sense camera. 
The project will involve a series of coordinated actions, including gathering the object's initial location from the camera, providing the first arm with the object's location — through TCP communication with the router — to pick it up and move it to a predetermined location, retrieving the object's new location from the camera, and commanding the second arm — through TCP communication with the router — to pick up and place the object into a designated bin.
